# Freddy Joel Torres Cabrera 📡

Telecommunications Engineer from **UPC (Barcelona)**. I focus on the intersection of technical infrastructure and business strategy. I spent a year and a half at **Cellnex Telecom** as a Technical Account Engineer, where I learned to translate complex technical requirements into real-world client solutions.

### 🛠️ Current Focus: My Bachelor's Thesis (TFG)
I'm building a **Web Architecture for Concurrent LLM Querying**.
* **The Problem:** Sequential API calls to multiple LLMs (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Llama) are slow and inefficient for real-time comparisons.
* **My Solution:** Developed an asynchronous backend using **FastAPI and Asyncio** to handle parallel requests, benchmarking latency and resource usage.
* **Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, and Docker.

### 💼 Professional Experience
* **Cellnex Telecom (1.5 years):** Worked as a Technical Account Engineer. I managed technical feasibility studies and supported the sales team by preparing technical proposals for large-scale infrastructure projects.
* **Education:** B.Sc. in Telecommunications Systems Engineering - EETAC - UPC.

### 🚀 What's Next?
* 🇺🇸 **Summer 2026:** I’ll be in the United States to fully immerse myself in a professional English environment.
* 💼 **October 2026:** I'm open to international opportunities in **Solutions Engineering, Backend Development, or Technical Project Management.**
